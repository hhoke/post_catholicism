 As I have aged, I've come to a new appreciation of the symbols and stories of Christianity, despite my denial of the supernatural and state of purposeful excommunion. I can illustrate this by walking through my understanding of Mary, the quintessential Catholic symbol, through different stages of my life:
  </p>

  <p><b>Fundamentalist Catholic</b>) Mary is Holy, the Mother of God born without Original Sin. Through her "Yes to God" she is the model of submission for the whole church, but especially women.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-Theist</b>) The constant talk of Mary's "Yes to God" is the Black Heart of Catholic misogyny, the core of a value system that views women as submissive baby factories and nothing more. This story is propaganda for both the everyday Patriarchy of Catholic family life, as well as the Kyriarchy of Church spiritual domination over the faithful.</p>

  <p><b>Post Catholic</b>) Mary is a reminder of the value women bring into the world, and the bravery it takes to undergo pregnancy. This danger is physical, but also existential, as every child brought into the world will eventually suffer and die. Still, Mary rejoices because she knows her child's suffering will be justified. Her example teaches us to value bringing things into existence and giving of ourselves to nurture them, even if they are flawed, and even if the world will not be kind to them. Her story is also misused by many to justify male domination.</p>
