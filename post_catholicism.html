  <h4> 1: God as Social Construction</h4>
  <p>
You ask "can I prove that God is not real?". I submit that you cannot, on several technicalities. First, there is the enormous (and, to me, fundamental) problem of defining "God". Second, while logical arguments and mathematical proofs can be said to be 'proven' in an iron-clad way, any kind of reasoning about the nature of reality requires induction and building up evidence. I think one can be very certain about the state of reality, even certain beyond reasonable doubt, i.e., certain enough to sentence a man to death. However, to make a technical point, you cannot fully prove something is true beyond any doubt absolutely. I think the only way one could actually prove the sentence "God is not real" is by handling analytic-philosophical arguments for "God", "is" and "real", and finding contradictions that explode some part of this sentence. 
  </p>
<p>Moving past that issue, I view such exercises as peripheral, not central, to the argument or dispute. In my view, "God" is best understood as a social construction.
Thus, the nature of god as a social constriction is what is central. 
In this spirit, I will not try (as others have before) to take a description of God, assume it is true, and describe why I find it horrible, or why it is inconsistent.
Further, in order to avoid accidental equivocation, I will use "God" from here on out to describe God-as-he-might-exist, i.e., the signified, and "god" as the signifier, which I believe to be the beginning and end of the entire phenomenon.
  </p>

  <p>
It is perfectly obvious that there is no God of the Bible. The Bible is filled with contradictions and was obviously cobbled together by men with agendas, out of earlier books, also written by men with agendas. It is clearly not the word of God, but the words of men. One could argue that these contradictory accounts are flawed human attempts to capture the multiple faces of one eternal God. There is none of this humility in the Bible itself. Each face, as written, seems to align with its authors' or editors' interests, though each claims to unerringly represent the One True God.
  </p>
<p>
I don't expect this brief argument to have convinced anyone who disagreed with me, but it is a necessary summary of how I see the truth of the Bible. For a serious treatment of the facts of the Bible's composition, I could not recommend more highly the book "Holy Resilience: The Bible’s Traumatic Origins" by David Carr of Union Theological Seminary. Carr gives a clear, well-researched explanation of the earthly origins of the Bible while recognizing the profound cultural value of biblical texts. (The tone is not that of a sneering, self-assuredly philistinic scientist, nor of some glossolalic apologist, as much writing on the topic has, but that of a true scholar of religion).
  </p>

  <p>
I am not an anti-theist or polemicist, nor am I a naive realist. I think that there is a sense (though a poorly-defined and intersubjectively variant one) in which Santa Claus is real. I do not deny the market price of a good, or the number one, or theoretical constructs such as atoms. However, compared to all these, even Santa Claus, God is the most poorly-defined of all. This is not without cause.
  </p>

  <h4> 2: The Beam in the Eye of the Church</h4>
  <p>
Religion, as I have experienced it, is fallen in epistemic vice. Biblical Stories and other fables are generally taught as literally true, but excused as fable or symbol after the absurdity of the literal truth is pointed out. They are called fables not for explication, but for apologism and excuse. People cannot really explain why they are doing the things they do, or in some cases even, precisely what they are doing at all. The whole thing is positively undead. You can feel the bloodlessness of many modern American churches when you step inside them. As Dr. King once warned, many a church has become "an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century"; worse than that, something corrupt and duplicitous. How could things have arrived at such a state?
  </p>
  <p>
I am tempted to say that established Christianity has no real standards of evidence. However, this is far from the truth. Most established Christian sects, especially Catholicism, have strong legalistic traditions. Any academic who reads the Catechism of the Catholic Church will be struck by the scholarly nature of the text. I recently<sup><a href="#*">*</a></sup> read the Catechism's section on sins, and was so struck. I was also bemused, in both senses of the word, that with all the weight of Tradition, Bible, and allegedly God on their side, the Church views "immoderate laughter" as a sin (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1856). What a load of shit. How to reconcile these two impressions, the recognition of both scholasticism and sophistry? Ultimately, a commitment to scholarly sophistication is nothing without a concomitant commitment to empiricism, accuracy, and emotional fidelity. The Church is a house built on a rotten foundation, and the rot creeps ever upward through the beams and walls.

  <h4> 3: Indoctrination </h4>
  <p>
Most churches indoctrinate children. They lie to children, they manipulate children. Should people who do this be trusted? The Catholic Church has sexually abused its children horribly. For this the church is rightly castigated. What of the spiritual abuse? Telling parents their children will burn in a lake of fire for eternity if they are not indoctrinated, based on no more evidence than ancient myths, legends, stories and rantings? I don't know whether to call it a dictatorship or anarchy, but it is made up of the epistemologically shameless. How many Sunday school teachers have I met, who just make shit up and pass it off--to second graders--as if it were the word of God? This, I think, captures the fundamental nature of god (lowercase). I say god is whatever the speaker needs him to be at that moment. 
  </p>
  <p>
Of course, many preachers and members of the faithful are not abusive. However, I think the environment of unquestionable authority is fundamentally ripe for permitting abuses of many kinds, and that it is negligent to profess as truth that for which one has no proof. It is wrong to speak and act as if something is the truth, and fall back on the excuse that it is faith only when questioned, as a kind of motte-and-bailey technique. Fundamentally, I view the profession "I believe in God" as something with conflicting social and empirical meanings, which is to say: a cowardly lie. In many cases it represents the successful completion of a process similar to the Asch conformity experiments, but more powerful, combined with something of becoming a citizen of a new country or member of a new family (that is, something to do with identity and group membership). It is something between "There are five lights", "I pledge allegiance, to the flag", "I do", and "I love Big Brother". I view most churches as machinery for indoctrination into a deeply authoritarian, autocratic epistemology.

  <p>
I will briefly describe systems of indoctrination whose goals are far more evil, brutal, direct, and well-studied, as an example. Take the type of systems used to indoctrinate a child soldier. He does not want to kill. He must be led through a haze of brutalization and rituals where increasing levels of violence become part of daily life. Finally, he must pass over into the soldier identity. To do this, he must kill. After he has committed the murder, he has two interpretive choices: a soldier who has completed his mission, or an abuse victim with innocent blood on his hands<a href="#cite2">[2]</a>{6,9}. Which identity do you think he chooses? 
</p>
<p>
  A system of indoctrination teaches the subject to do what should be loathsome to them. In the case of many Christian churches, the lesson is to adopt an obscure, authoritarian epistemological process as primary. This is in place of having one's own connection to reality as primary, that is, one's own method of sense-making or way of coming to understand more about reality. The church offers a choice resembling the killer/abuser choice outlined above: you can be a manipulated pushover, or a believer. As in other systems, they tell you what to do and how to feel about it, repeatedly and under duress. In most churches, there is no physical force. You could walk out at any time, but everything told to you and every social cue there is says that if you do so, something terrible will happen. Simply being in a church habituates one to conformity, of saying things one does not understand, accepting proclamations without interrogation. Rise, kneel, sit, sing, <i>Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison</i>. Rituals can be useful, but here they are being used for spiritual exploitation. You kneel because everyone else kneels, and they tell you you're kneeling before God. 
</p>
<p>
  I have less personal experience with Protestant churches, but what I've seen and heard tells me that they can be even more controlling than Catholic ones, despite more theological emphasis on a personal relationship with God and personal revelation. In many evangelical churches, there is a "small group" Bible study structure where one is encouraged to express doubts privately while publicly expressing only faith. That is how you keep a congregation half-full of atheists coming to church, each thinking they are alone or must be mistaken, mixed up and misdirected by their mentors. In addition to these more cerebral manipulations, most established religions also enforce compliance through influence tactics and straightforward positive and negative incentives.
</p>
<p>
  Catholic and Protestant churches largely share the same basic indoctrination process. Through your average church service, blatant lies are asserted as if self-evident. One is told that one is sinful if one does not repent, or alternatively that some incredible riches could be yours if you just buy in to the gospel of prosperity. Every passing moment of compliance builds weight to smother the possibility of independence. It's like the "Foot in the Door" sales tactic. Believe me, the pressure is there. If you haven't already, try ignoring the order of mass and listen to the whispers against you (whispers at the very least). Shame is the stick.

  <p>
  On the other hand, it is also perfectly obvious that a given church provides an obviously valuable, and in many locations, indispensable, community. In most churches there is a place for everyone. You might object, given the strict morals and competition around such that many churches have. Many churches are hostile to LGBT people, or even use them as a kind of bogeyman outgroup or scapegoat. Still, even rounding up the best estimates, that's only 5% of the population <a href="#cite1">[1]</a>{7,9}. How many community spaces have no space for the elderly, or for children? How many establishments actually make one feel part of a community, feel that sense of belonging and love? This is a precious thing. This is one of the sources of their power -- the power to take away your sense of belonging, turn off that love in an instant, if you cross them.<sup><a href="#**">**</a></sup> Love is the carrot.

  <h4> 4: A Terrifying Proposition</h4>

  <p>
Perhaps all the benefits of religious community are not possible without a lie. Perhaps the structure of the lies and the manipulation requires a god to stay functional. Perhaps, god exists because such a structure of lies and manipulation requires a central, all-powerful lie, with the strength to absorb any truth, or assume whatever significance that is required: a black hole of meaning. Or, perhaps it is simply one lie out of many, one more manipulation tactic. It could be that what holds some communities together is simply the manipulation tactics, the social and institutional structure itself. In this understanding, the central belief would be largely interchangeable. This is true to some extent -- there are political cults, yoga cults, business cults, therapy cults. However, I think the function of god in most churches is deeply metaphysical: to be the ultimate Source of misbegotten authority, the Father of Lies.
  </p>
  <h4> 5: Post Catholicism</h4>
  <p>
That's a question for me, and perhaps for you. Can we have religion, our vital rituals and our vital community, with honesty? I see value in all these things -- open, warm community, rituals that bring people together, confession, the Bible and its stories, deontological ethics, the sanctity of the individual in some respects. If we abandon god, it feels like these institutions will fall apart. For me there is no real choice -- even if God were real, I can't tolerate the Church's autocracy. As it is, I don't trust anyone who appeals to the supernatural. The leap of faith I choose to make is to follow my own truth instead of some other man's god. I welcome anyone who shares my core convictions:

- Empiricism: There is such a thing as The Truth, an objective reality, and if we work together, with reason and evidence as our guiding light, we can come closer to it, or at least close enough to continue to work together
- Anti-Nihilism: Through sacrifice, choice, and intention, properly applied, we can find meaning and make our world a better place

  </p>
  <p>
These are both deeply Christian ideals, stripped of any supernatural element until there remains only faith itself, clearly stated (at least, that is my hope). I reject the threat of supernatural punishment and promise of supernatural reward, as I reject special pleading for a source of inscrutable, exclusive knowledge. I reject god. However, I acknowledge that at some point, faith must come into consideration. I think that the path to honest, genuine friendship is through making statements of such faith as clear and as plainly understandable as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
  Am I any better off now? One could try to deconstruct the idea of Truth, as Foucault has done<a href="#cite3">[3]</a>{}. However, while both truth and god are abused, in modern society the mechanisms for confirming the alignment of some truth with The Truth are valid, largely speaking, whereas the mechanisms used for confirming the alignment of a given god with God are bankrupt, because God is either claimed to have some special properties outside the natural order, or to have revealed himself exclusively to some person or group. Science has been improving.
  </p>

  <p>
  I leave you with Christopher Hitchen's final benediction before dying<a href="#cite4">[4]</a>{}, which I have adopted as my own when discussing matters of faith:
  </p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/18/christopher-hitchens-atheism-dawkins-award-speech">
  in the meantime, we have the same job we always had, to say as thinking people and as humans that there are no final solutions.<BR>
  There is no absolute truth, no supreme leader. There is no totalitarian solution that says that if you will just give up your freedom of inquiry.<BR>
  If you will just give up.<BR>
  If you will simply abandon your critical faculties, a world of idiotic bliss can be yours.<BR>
  But we have to begin by repudiating all such claims.<BR>
  Grand rabbis, chief ayatollahs, infallible popes, the peddlers of surrogate and mutant quasi-political religion and worship, the dear leader, the great leader.<BR>
  We have no need for any of this.<BR>
  And looking at them, and their record, and the pathos of their supporters, I realize it is they who are the grand imposters, and my own imposture this evening is mild by comparison.<BR>
</blockquote>

  <p>
I still have many questions. Should we try to reconstruct churchlike communities on these new foundations? What would they look like? Should such institutions be left behind entirely?
  </p>
  <p>
    We have begun by repudiating the superstitious claims of traditional Christianity. That is to say: the real work is ahead of us.

<p style="margin-left: 1.5em", id="*"> <b>*</b> Recently, I had come to recognize the profound value of the ritual of confession, penance, and reconciliation in my own live, and decided to read the catechism to see what wisdom I could glean.
<p style="margin-left: 1.5em", id="**"> <b>**</b> I am intentionally vague here. To explain, I will have to differentiate between a cult and a religion. A cult is simply an abusive religion. Much like an abusive boyfriend, a cult is controlling, won't let you see your friends, uses extreme manipulation tactics, may try to separate you from your family, and will take advantage of you and mistreat you. Won't let you do hardly anything. That is an extreme example. Many people have good relationships with religion. However, there is always something you cannot do, a line you cannot cross. The question one must ask oneself is "what is that line?" and "is this worth it to me?" or "can I live with this?".
