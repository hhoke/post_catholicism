  <h1>Post Catholicism</h1>
  <h3>(A letter to a questioning believer, and a confession of Faith)</h3>

  <p>
It is our lot, our duty, our privilege, our honor to wrestle with god.
  </p>

  <p>
Before we begin, a bible passage:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ...cursed is the ground because of you;<BR>
    in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;<BR>
    thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you;<BR>
    and you shall eat the plants of the field.<BR>
    In the sweat of your face<BR>
    you shall eat bread<BR>
    till you return to the ground,<BR>
    for out of it you were taken;<BR>
    you are dust,<BR>
    and to dust you shall return.<BR>

    [Genesis 3:16-19]
  </blockquote>

  <p>
The bread of life, logos, knowledge, what have you -- only in toil shall you eat of it. To struggle is our lot in life. This is deep wisdom, I think. It's a bit of a paradox. I believe that it is only through struggle can what it truly worthwhile come to fruition.

You say "can I prove that God is not real?". I submit that you cannot, on several technicalities. First, there is the enormous (and, to me, fundamental) problem of defining "God". Secondly, while logical arguments and mathematical proofs can be said to be 'proven' in an iron-clad way, any kind of reasoning about the nature of reality requires induction, and building up evidence. You can be very certain about the state of reality, even certain beyond reasonable doubt, i.e., certain enough to send a man to his death. However, on a technical point, you cannot fully prove something is true beyond any doubt absolutely. I think the only way one could actually prove "God" is not real is by handling analytic-philosophical arguments for "God", "is" and "real", and trying to find contradictions that explode some part of this sentence. However, fundamentally I view such exercises as peripheral, not central, to the argument or dispute. However, I have my own extensive views on the matters which I do view as central, namely the nature of God as a social construction.
  </p>

  <p>
"God" is best understood as a social construction. I will not try, as others have before, to take a description of God, assume it is true, and describe why I find it horrible, or why it is inconsistent. In order to avoid accidental equivocation, I will use "God" from here on out to describe God-as-he-might-exist, i.e., the signified, and "god" as the signifier, which I believe to be the beginning and end of the entire phenomenon.
  </p>

  <p>
It is perfectly obvious that there is no God of the bible. The bible is filled with contradictions, and was obviously cobbled together by men with agendas, out of earlier books, also written by men with agendas. One could argue that these are multiple faces of the eternal God. Suspicious, then, how each face seems to align with author or editor's interests, though each claims His Face is the One True God. One the facts of the bible's composition, I could not recommend more highly the book "Holy Resilience: The Bible’s Traumatic Origins", by David Carr of Union Theological Seminary. It manages to give a clear, well-researched explanation of the earthly origins of the bible, while recognizing the profound cultural value these books have. (the tone is not that of the sneering, self-assured scientist e.g. Dawkins). Since reading this book, I have come to a new appreciation of the symbols and stories of Christianity. I can illustrate this best by walking you through my understanding of Mary, the quintessential Catholic symbol, through different stages of my life:
  </p>

  <p><b>Fundamentalist Catholic</b>) Mary is Holy, the Mother of God born without Original Sin. Through her "Yes to God" she is the model of submission for the whole church, but especially women.</p>

  <p><b>Anti-Theist</b>) The constant talk of Mary's "Yes to God" is the Black Heart of Catholic misogyny, the core of a value system that views women as submissive baby factories and nothing more. This story is propaganda for not only the daily Patriarchy of Catholic family life, but the Kyriarchy of Church spiritual domination over the faithful.</p>

  <p><b>Post Catholic</b>) Mary is a reminder of the value women bring into the world, and the bravery it takes to undergo pregnancy. This danger is physical, but also existential, as every child brought into the world will eventually suffer and die. Still, Mary rejoices because she knows her child's suffering will be justified. Her example teaches us to value bringing things into existence, giving of ourselves to nurture them, even if they are flawed, and even if the world will not be kind to them. Her story is also misused by many to justify male domination.</p>

  <p>
I am tempted to say that it is perfectly obvious that there are no real standards of evidence in Religion. However, there is a strong legalistic tradition in most major religions. Any academic who reads the Catechism of the Catholic Church will be struck with the scholarly nature of the text. I recently read the section on sins, because I have recently come to recognize the profound value of the ritual of confession, penance, and reconciliation, and was so struck. I was also bemused, in both senses, that, with all the weight of Tradition, bible, and allegedly God on their side, the Church views "immoderate laughter" as a sin (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1856). What a load of shit. How to reconcile these two impressions? I think, culturally, the west and The Academy owe some inheritance to the Catholic Church and its offshoots. Ultimately, a commitment to scholarly sophistication is nothing without a concomitant commitment to empiricism and accuracy. The Church is a house built on a rotten foundation, and the rot creeps ever upward through the beams and walls.

  <p>
Most churches indoctrinate children. They lie to children, they manipulate children. Should these people be trusted? The Catholic Church has sexually abused its children horribly. For this they are rightly castigated. What of the spiritual abuse? Telling parents their children will burn in a lake of fire for eternity if they are not indoctrinated, based on the no more evidence than ancient myths, legends, stories and rantings? This is an epistemological dictatorship of the shameless. How many Sunday school teachers do you know that just make shit up and pass it off to second graders as if it were the word of God? This, I think, captures the fundamental nature of god. I say god is whatever the speaker needs him to be at that moment. Of course, many preachers and members of the faithful are not abusive. However, I think the environment of unquestionable authority is fundamentally ripe for this, and it is negligent to profess as the truth that for which you have no proof. It is wrong to speak as if something in the truth, and fall back on the excuse that it is faith only when questioned. Fundamentally, I view the profession "I believe in God" as the successful completion of a process similar to the Asch conformity experiments, but more powerful, combined with something of becoming a citizen of a new country or member of a new family. It is something between "There are four lights", "I pledge Allegiance, to the flag", "I do", and "I love Big Brother". I view most churches as machinery for indoctrination into a deeply authoritarian, autocratic epistemology.

  <p>
  A system of indoctrination teaches the subject to do what should be loathsome to them. In the case of religion, the lesson is to adopt an obscure, authoritarian epistemological process as primary. This is in place of having one's own connection to reality as primary, that is, one's own method of sense-making or way of coming to understand more about reality. I will briefly describe systems of indoctrination whose goals are far more evil, brutal, direct, and well-studied, as an example. Take the example of the child soldier. He does not want to kill. He must be led through a haze of brutalization and rituals where increasing levels of violence become part of daily life. Finally, he must pass over into the soldier identity. To do this, he must kill. After he has committed the murder, he has two choices: loyal, purpose-driven soldier or abused, wanton killer<a href="#cite2">[2]</a>{6,9}. Which identity do you think he chooses? Similarly, simply being in a church habituates one to conformity, of saying things one does not understand, accepting proclamations without interrogation. Rise, Kneel, sit, sing, <i>Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison</i>. Rituals can be useful, but they can also be exploited. You kneel because everyone else is, and they tell you you're kneeling before God. I have less personal experience with protestant churches. My understanding is that in evangelical churches, there is a "small group" bible study structure where one is encouraged to express doubts privately and assent publicly. That is how you keep a congregation half-full of atheists coming to church, each thinking they are alone or must be mistaken, mixed up and redirected by their mentors. Through your average church service, blatant lies are asserted as if self-evident. One is told that one is sinful if one does not Repent, or alternatively that some incredible riches can be yours if you just buy in. Every moment of compliance, the weight against your independence increases. Believe me, the pressure is there. If you haven't already, try ignoring the order of mass and listen to the whispers against you (whispers at the very least). Shame is the stick.

  <p>
  On the other hand, it is also perfectly obvious that a given church provides a obviously valuable, and in many communities indispensable, community. In most churches there is a place for everyone. You might object, given the strict morals and competition around such that many churches have. Many churches are hostile to LGBT people, or even use them as a kind of bogeyman outgroup or scapegoat. Still, even rounding up the best estimates, that's only 5% of the population <a href="#cite1">[1]</a>{7,9}. How many community spaces have no space for the elderly, and for children? How many establishments actually make one feel part of a community, feel that sense of belonging and love? This is a precious thing. This is one of the sources of their power -- the power to take away your sense of belonging, turn off that love in an instant, if you cross them.<sup><a href="#*">*</a></sup> That's the carrot.

  <p>
There is a truly terrifying proposition: perhaps all the benefits of religious community are not possible without a lie. Perhaps the structure of the lies and the manipulation requires a god to stay functional. Perhaps, god exists because such a structure of lies and manipulation requires a central, all-powerful lie, with the strength to absorb any truth, or assume whatever significance that is required: a black hole of meaning. Or, perhaps it is simply one lie out of many, one more manipulation tactic. Perhaps what holds some communities together is simply the manipulation tactics, the structure itself. In this understanding, the central belief would be largely interchangeable. This is true to some extent -- there are political cults, yoga cults, business cults, therapy cults. However, I think the function of god in most churches is to be the ultimate Source of misbegotten authority, the Father of Lies.

  <p>
That's a question for me, and perhaps for you. Can we have religion, our vital rituals and our vital community, with honesty? I see value in all these things -- open, warm community, rituals that bring people together, confession, the Bible and its stories, deontological ethics, the sanctity of the individual in some respects. If we abandon god, it feels like these institutions will fall apart. For me there is no real choice -- even if God were real, I disdain the autocratic Church. As it is, I don't trust anyone who appeals to the supernatural. The leap of faith I choose to make is to follow my own truth instead of some other man's god. I welcome anyone who shares my core convictions:

- Empiricism: There is such a thing as The Truth, an objective reality, and if we work together, with reason and evidence as our guiding light, we can come closer to it, or at least close enough to continue to work together
- Anti-Nihilism: Through sacrifice, choice, and intention, properly applied, we can find meaning and make our world a better place

  <p>
These are both deeply Christian ideals, stripped of any supernatural element until there remains only my faith itself, clearly stated (at least, that is my hope). I reject the threat of supernatural punishment and promise of supernatural reward, as I reject special pleading for a source of inscrutable, exclusive knowledge. I reject god. However, I acknowledge that at some point, faith must come into consideration. I think that the path to honest, genuine friendship is through making statements of such faith as clear and as plainly understandable as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
  One could try to deconstruct the idea of Truth, as Foucault has done<a href="#cite3">[3]</a>{}. However, while both truth and god are abused, in modern society the mechanisms for confirming the alignment of some truth with The Truth are valid, largely speaking, whereas the mechanisms used for confirming the alignment of a given god with God are bankrupt, because God is either claimed to have some special properties outside the natural order, or to have revealed himself exclusively to some person or group.
  </p>

  <p>
  I leave you with Christopher Hitchen's final benediction before dying<a href="#cite4">[4]</a>{}, which I have adopted as my own when discussing matters of faith:
  </p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/18/christopher-hitchens-atheism-dawkins-award-speech">
  in the meantime, we have the same job we always had, to say as thinking people and as humans that there are no final solutions.<BR>
  There is no absolute truth, no supreme leader. There is no totalitarian solution that says that if you will just give up your freedom of inquiry.<BR>
  If you will just give up.<BR>
  If you will simply abandon your critical faculties, a world of idiotic bliss can be yours.<BR>
  But we have to begin by repudiating all such claims.<BR>
  Grand rabbis, chief ayatollahs, infallible popes, the peddlers of surrogate and mutant quasi-political religion and worship, the dear leader, the great leader.<BR>
  We have no need for any of this.<BR>
  And looking at them, and their record, and the pathos of their supporters, I realize it is they who are the grand imposters, and my own imposture this evening is mild by comparison.<BR>
</blockquote>

  <p>
I still have many questions. Should we try to reconstruct churchlike communities on these new foundations? What would they look like? Should such institutions be left behind entirely?
  </p>
  <p>
    We have begun by repudiating the claims of traditional religions. That is to say: the real work is ahead of us.

<div class="footnote">
<p style="margin-left: 1.5em", id="*"> <b>*</b> I am intentionally vague here. To explain, I will have to differentiate between a cult and a religion. A cult is simply an abusive religion. Much like an abusive boyfriend, a cult is controlling, won't let you see your friends, uses extreme manipulation tactics, may try to separate you from your family, and will take advantage of you and mistreat you. Won't let you do hardly anything. That is an extreme example. Many people have good relationships with religion. However, there is always something you cannot do, a line you cannot cross. The question one must ask oneself is "what is that line?" and "is this worth it to me?" or "can I live with this?".
